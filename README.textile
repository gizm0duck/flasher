h1. Flasher

Flasher is a quick way to get pretty flash message for :error, :notice, and :success keys out of the box for Rails apps.  Setup is fairly simple, but may take some tweeking if you are not using blueprint.css or something similar.  
If you aren't I recommend "checking it out":http://wiki.github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css

h2. Installation

This will work out of the box if you are using Blueprint css or something similar, otherwise it will take some tweaking to show up perfect.

Copy the flasher/files/icons directory into public/images/icons
Copy the css that you need out of the flasher/files/flasher.css file into one of your stylesheets
Insert: <%= flasher_helper %> somewhere in your layout

Get pretty stuff like this:
